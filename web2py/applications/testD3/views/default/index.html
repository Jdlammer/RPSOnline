<h4>This week, August 4-10, 2013 was called "Geek Week" by Google. 
<br>
To celebrate that I experimented with the D3.js library and am sharing with
my friends in the Web2Py community.

<br>
I wanted more experience with animations using svg and images with D3.js,
and so these are not chart examples, but I could not find examples with 
images and svg using D3.js, and others might find these useful.

After creating a copy of the scaffolding app named 'welcome', I modified
the views/layout.html and added the d3 views to views/default/ directory. 
References are provided.
